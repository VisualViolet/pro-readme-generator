# Professional README Generator

## Description

This application uses node.js and Inquirer to obtain user input and write a professional README.md file. This week in the UW Coding Bootcamp, we have started our journey into back-end development. This project helped me to reinforce concepts surrounding this JavaScript runtime environment and learn how to install packages and use integrated terminal to create an interactive application. Additionally, this application provides an easy way to generate a professional README.md file for any project as it is tailored to your responses.

## Installation

No installation is necessary. As this will not be a deployed application, a live demonstration of this applications functionality can be viewed here:

## Usage

This applications main usage is to generate a README.md file. It is run through the integrated terminal using the "node index.js" command. The inqurier package will ask a series of questions about your project and prompt for input. Once all the questions have been answered, your README file will be automatically generated! The console will let you know when your file has completed or if there was an error during the process. Please view the live demonstration in the link above for a more detailed walkthrough. Students and new developers may also find it worthwhile to view the code to see how this application runs. Code has been commented for functionality.

## Credits

The Inqurier.js package was used for prompting. Please view the documentation, along with instructions to install, here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer.
